## How to make a reusable workflow
### First off
- You can find an example of a rightfully made reusable workflow here : @ULYSSE CHANGE THIS
- The auto documentation will create a .md from only your reusable workflow :rocket:.
- Once your workflow is merged into the repository, it will create the .md file with the same name as your action.
  You will then be able to update this documentation if it's missing any important information.
  For example if you have 2 examples for your reusable workflow, you will be able to change the documentation to add context to those, if the description inside the workflow is not enough.

**Make your changes outside the brackets in the file, otherwise it will be overwritten**
