# How to request a dev in GHA Shared
## Issue template
First start with creating an issue with the request template on the GHA Board: https://github.com/orgs/energypool/projects/63/views/1

"New issue" -> "Feature request"

## Slack Channel
Once your issue is created or if the request does not fall into a request issue, you can notify the team with the corresponding Slack channel : #gha_shared
