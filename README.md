# GitHub Actions Shared
## Welcome to EnergyPool's shared GitHub Actions Repository

### What is it?
This Repository is here to share all the reusable workflows that could be used for Everest and other projects. 
- You will find the list of reusable workflows at the end of this file. They are marked with this emoji :rocket:

**They are in different directories but are always synched with the .github/workflow, so they can be called from 
another repository.**
- You will also find at the same place the documentation (same name .md file), and the  minimal working workflow 
for this reusable. They are marked with this emoji :checked:
- Other workflows that are used for this repository only are marked with :X:


### How to use
Once you found the reusable workflow that you want to use, first you can check the .md file with the same name as the 
workflow. 
You can also check the workflows in the same directory with the emoji :marked:, 
it's an example of the minimum working workflow.


### How to participate
If you want to make reusable workflows for this repository, please check the documentation :
